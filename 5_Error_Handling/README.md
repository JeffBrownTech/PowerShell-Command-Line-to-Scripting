## Module 5: Error Handling in PowerShell

Welcome to Module 5! In this module, you'll learn how to handle and respond to errors in your scripts using PowerShell's built-in error handling features. You'll discover how to write more resilient and reliable scripts by anticipating problems and responding to them gracefully.

---

## üìö What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Identify different types of errors in PowerShell
- Use `Try`, `Catch`, and `Finally` to handle errors safely
- Control how PowerShell responds to errors using `-ErrorAction`
- Raise your own errors using `Throw`
- Log and report errors for easier troubleshooting
- Use `Get-Error` to explore detailed error information (PowerShell 7+)
