# ðŸ§© PowerShell Scripting Course

## Module 6: Working with External Files and APIs

Welcome to Module 6! In this module, you'll learn how to read from and write to external files and communicate with web-based APIs using PowerShell. These skills will help you build scripts that interact with real-world data â€” from local logs and user lists to live data from remote servers.

---

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Read and write data using CSV, JSON, and XML files
* Import and export structured data for reuse and sharing
* Call web APIs using `Invoke-RestMethod` and `Invoke-WebRequest`
* Pass headers, query parameters, and body content to external services
* Parse and store remote data in PowerShell objects
