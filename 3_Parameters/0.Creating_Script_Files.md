# Creating Script Files

This section is for any learners who are unfamiliar with creating PowerShell script files (```.ps1```). This and remaining modules focus more on writing and running script files instead of using Jupyter notebooks.

## Step 1: Open a Text Editor

You can write PowerShell scripts using any text editor, but the recommended options are:

- (Best) Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the PowerShell extension
  - [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  - [PowerShell plugin by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell)
- PowerShell ISE (Built-in on Windows)
- Notepad (for quick edits)

## Step 2: Create a New Script File
1. Open VS Code (or another editor)
2. Click **File** â†’ **New File**
3. Save the file with a ```.ps1``` extension. Example: ```MyScript.ps1```

## Step 3: Set Execution Policy (If Needed)
By default, Windows may prevent running PowerShell scripts for security reasons. To allow script execution:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:
   ```Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser```
3. Type ```Y``` and press **Enter**.

This allows locally created scripts to run while keeping security in place for downloaded scripts.

## Step 4: Navigate to the Script Location
Before executing your script, make sure you're in the correct folder:

1. Open PowerShell.
2. Change to the directory where your script is saved using the cd command:
   ```cd C:\Path\To\Your\Script```

   Example:
   ```cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents```

## Step 5: Execute the Script
Run your script using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using .\
```.\MyScript.ps1```

### Method 2: Using powershell.exe (less common)
```powershell.exe -File MyScript.ps1```
