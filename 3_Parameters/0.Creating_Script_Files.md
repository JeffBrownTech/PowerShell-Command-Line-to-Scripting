## Setup Guide: Creating Script Files

This guide is for learners who are unfamiliar with creating PowerShell script files (`.ps1`). From this point forward, the course will focus more on writing and running script files instead of using Jupyter notebooks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Open a Text Editor

You can write PowerShell scripts using any text editor, but the recommended options are:

* **Best:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the PowerShell extension

  * [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  * [PowerShell plugin by Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell)
* PowerShell ISE (Built-in on Windows)
* Notepad (for quick edits)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a New Script File

1. Open **VS Code** (or another editor)
2. Click **File** ‚Üí **New File**
3. Save the file with a `.ps1` extension

   * Example: `MyScript.ps1`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Set Execution Policy (If Needed)

By default, Windows may prevent running PowerShell scripts for security reasons. To allow script execution:

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**

2. Run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. Type `Y` and press **Enter**

> üí° This setting allows *locally created scripts* to run, while still protecting your system from unsigned *downloaded scripts*.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Navigate to the Script Location

Before executing your script, make sure you're in the correct folder:

1. Open **PowerShell**
2. Change to the directory where your script is saved:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Path\To\Your\Script
   ```

   Example:

   ```powershell
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents
   ```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Execute the Script

You can run your script using either of the following methods:

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Method 1: Using `.\` (Recommended)

```powershell
.\MyScript.ps1
```

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Method 2: Using `powershell.exe` (Less common)

```powershell
powershell.exe -File MyScript.ps1
```
