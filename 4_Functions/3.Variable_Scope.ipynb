    "# Topic 3: Understanding Variable Scope in PowerShell Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope refers to where in your script a variable is visible or accessible. In PowerShell, not all variables are visible everywhere. The scope determines:\n",
    "- Where a variable can be used\n",
    "- Where a variable was created\n",
    "- Whether one part of the script can affect variables in another part\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Is Scope Important in Functions?\n",
    "When you define a variable inside a function, it usually only exists inside that function. If you try to use that variable outside the function, it wonâ€™t be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior prevents variables from accidentally interfering with each other and helps keep your scripts clean and predictable."
