    "# Getting Started with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In PowerShell, a function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can \"call\" the function by its name whenever you need to run that task. Think of a function like a kitchen recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "You give it a name (\"Make-Pancakes\").\n",
    "\n",
    "It has a list of steps (the code). You follow the steps every time you want the same result. You can reuse it as many times as you like, without rewriting it. Or like a tool in your toolbox — once it’s built, you can just grab it and use it when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions should have a single purpose - whether it's calculating a value, starting a service, or logging to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Functions?\n",
    "- Reusability: Write once, use many times.\n",
    "- Clean Code: Break large scripts into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "- Easier Testing: Test individual pieces of logic.\n",
    "- Improved Readability: Functions have descriptive names that show what they do."
