    "# Getting Started with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In PowerShell, a function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. Once you define a function, you can run it at any time by calling its name, without having to rewrite the same code. The function contains a series of steps that you follow each time to get the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like a tool in your toolbox — once it’s built, you can grab it and use it whenever you need that task done. Functions should have a single purpose — whether it’s calculating a value, starting a service, or logging to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Use Functions?\n",
    "- Reusability: Write once, use many times.\n",
    "- Clean Code: Break large scripts into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "- Easier Testing: Test individual pieces of logic.\n",
    "- Improved Readability: Functions have descriptive names that show what they do."
