# Planning Your Script

Before writing any PowerShell script, the most effective developers spend time **thinking**. Planning out your logic, clarifying the problem, and breaking it into manageable steps will help you write cleaner, more maintainable scripts and avoid common mistakes.

## Understand the Problem

Before you write a single line of PowerShell, ask yourself:

* What am I trying to accomplish?
* What are the **inputs** and what should be the **outputs**?
* Are there **special rules** or **error conditions** I should account for?
* What would a successful script *look like*?

**Example**:
"I need a script that checks free disk space on a list of servers and emails me if any of them fall below 10%."

## Break Down the Problem

Break the task into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For the disk space example:
1. Get a list of servers
2. Connect to each server
3. Check disk usage
4. Compare usage against threshold
5. Store results
6. Send email if needed

If you find a step that feels complicated, break *that* down even further.

## Write Pseudocode

**Pseudocode** is a way to outline your logic in plain English (or whatever language you're comfortable thinking in) without worrying about syntax.

Here’s an example for our disk space task:

```text
For each server in the list:
    Try to connect
    If connection is successful:
        Get disk space
        If free space < 10%:
            Add to alert list
If alert list is not empty:
    Send email with server names and free space info
```

Pseudocode helps you think logically and spot gaps *before* dealing with syntax.

## Create a Script Skeleton

Now use your pseudocode to lay out the **structure** of your PowerShell script. This may include:

* A `param()` block for input parameters
* One or more helper functions
* A `try/catch` block for error handling
* A `main` section that calls each piece in order

```powershell
param (
    [string[]]$ServerList,
    [int]$Threshold = 10
)

function Get-DiskUsage { ... }

function Send-AlertEmail { ... }

# Main logic
foreach ($server in $ServerList) {
    try {
        $usage = Get-DiskUsage -Server $server
        if ($usage.FreePercent -lt $Threshold) {
            # Add to alert list
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Warning "Failed to connect to $server"
    }
}

if ($AlertList.Count -gt 0) {
    Send-AlertEmail -Servers $AlertList
}
```

## Define Parameters, Decisions, and Error Handling

* What should be configurable via `param()`? (e.g., thresholds, email addresses)
* What should happen when something fails?
* What logic is conditional or repeatable?

Write these down before you code — it will shape how you structure your script.

## Tips for Effective Planning

* Don’t rush into writing the script. Think through the problem.
* Use pseudocode or flowcharts to sketch out the logic.
* Build incrementally: test each piece as you go.
* Assume errors *will* happen — plan for them.
* Reuse functions if a task might be repeated in future scripts.

## Summary

Taking time to plan before you script results in:

* Fewer bugs
* Cleaner logic
* Easier debugging and updates
* Code that others can read and reuse
