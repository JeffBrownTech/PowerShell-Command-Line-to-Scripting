# PowerShell Scripting Best Practices

Writing a working script is just the beginning. In this lesson, you’ll learn the *best practices* that separate beginner scripts from professional-grade tools. Whether you're working solo or in a team, well-structured code is easier to read, troubleshoot, and reuse.

## Naming Conventions

Clear, consistent names make your scripts easier to understand.

### Variables

Use descriptive names:

```powershell
$diskUsage = 20
```

❌ Avoid vague or abbreviated names like `$du` or `$x`.

### Functions

Follow the **Verb-Noun** format:

```powershell
function Get-UserReport { ... }
function Set-ConfigFile { ... }
```

Use approved PowerShell verbs. You can see them with:

```powershell
Get-Verb
```

### Script Files

Use meaningful file names:

```text
Check-DiskSpace.ps1
Export-AzureUsers.ps1
```

## Formatting and Layout

Consistent formatting makes your code easier to read and less error-prone.

* **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
* **Line breaks**: Use blank lines to separate sections of code.
* **Line length**: Keep lines to 100 characters or less when possible.
* **Braces**: Open `{` on the same line.

```powershell
if ($spaceUsed -gt 90) {
    Write-Warning "Disk space is above 90%"
}
```

Avoid long chains of logic without whitespace or structure.

## Commenting and Documentation

Your code should explain itself, but *helpful comments* and documentation fill in the gaps.

### Inline Comments

Use comments to explain **why**, not just what.

```powershell
# Skip if server is unreachable
if (-not (Test-Connection $server -Quiet -Count 1)) {
    continue
}
```

### Comment-Based Help

At the top of your scripts and functions, add help metadata:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
Checks disk space on multiple servers.

.PARAMETER ServerList
List of server names to check.

.EXAMPLE
.\Check-DiskSpace.ps1 -ServerList "SRV01","SRV02"
#>
```

You can view this help using `Get-Help`.


## Use of Output and Messaging

PowerShell gives you multiple ways to communicate with users.

### `Write-Output`

Use for data your script produces:

```powershell
Write-Output $userList
```

### `Write-Information`
Introduced in PowerShell 5.0, this cmdlet lets you write general-purpose informational messages that can be programmatically captured or displayed.

```powershell
Write-Information "Backup process started at $(Get-Date)"
```

By default, information messages are not displayed unless you specify:

```powershell
$InformationPreference = 'Continue'
```

Or run the script with:

```powershell
.\MyScript.ps1 -InformationAction Continue
```

This is great for logging or emitting structured info during a run without using Verbose or polluting the output stream.

**When to use Write-Information?**

Use it for general status messages that are not errors, not warnings, and not debug details. These can be useful for logging or custom UI tools.

### `Write-Verbose`

Use for optional status messages:

```powershell
Write-Verbose "Checking server $server"
```

(Enable with `-Verbose` parameter.)

### `Write-Warning`, `Write-Error`

Use when something goes wrong or needs attention:

```powershell
Write-Warning "Disk space low on $server"
```

### Output and Messaging Table

| Cmdlet              | Purpose                       | Output Stream |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| `Write-Output`      | Send data to the pipeline     | Stream 1      |
| `Write-Verbose`     | Optional detailed info        | Stream 4      |
| `Write-Warning`     | Highlight cautionary messages | Stream 3      |
| `Write-Error`       | Report serious issues         | Stream 2      |
| `Write-Information` | General information messages  | Stream 6      |


### ❌ Avoid excessive `Write-Host`

`Write-Host` prints to the console directly but does *not* return data to the pipeline.

## Error Handling

Plan for failure. A script that only works under perfect conditions is unreliable.

### Use Try/Catch Blocks

```powershell
try {
    Get-Content -Path $logFile
} catch {
    Write-Warning "Failed to read log file: $_"
}
```

### Use `-ErrorAction`

Control error behavior for individual commands:

```powershell
Get-Item -Path "C:\missing.txt" -ErrorAction Stop
```

### ✅ Use `$Error` or `Get-Error`

Inspect past errors for debugging:

```powershell
$Error[0] | Format-List
```

## Avoid Hardcoding

Don’t bake values into your script. Make them configurable.

### Not Good Practice

```powershell
$threshold = 90
$serverList = @("Server1", "Server2")
```

### Best Practices

```powershell
param (
    [int]$Threshold = 90,
    [string[]]$ServerList
)
```

Also consider config files or environment variables when appropriate.

## Avoid Using Aliases in Scripts

Aliases like `ls`, `gc`, `?`, and `%` are convenient for **interactive use**, but you should avoid them in production scripts and functions.

| Alias | Full Cmdlet      |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `ls`  | `Get-ChildItem`  |
| `gc`  | `Get-Content`    |
| `?`   | `Where-Object`   |
| `%`   | `ForEach-Object` |

### Not Best Practice

```powershell
ls *.log | ? { $_.Length -gt 1MB }
```

### Better

```powershell
Get-ChildItem *.log | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 1MB }
```

✅ **Why?**
Scripts should be clear to *everyone*, not just PowerShell veterans. Using full cmdlet names improves **readability**, **portability**, and avoids issues with remapped or removed aliases.

## Use Functions and Modular Logic

Split large scripts into **reusable functions**. This improves readability and makes testing easier.

```powershell
function Get-DiskUsage {
    param($Server)
    # logic here
}

function Send-Alert {
    param($ServerList)
    # logic here
}

# Main logic
foreach ($server in $ServerList) {
    $usage = Get-DiskUsage -Server $server
    if ($usage -gt $Threshold) {
        Send-Alert -ServerList $server
    }
}
```

Also consider moving reusable functions into a PowerShell module.

## Write Reusable and Testable Code

Code should be **predictable** and **minimal in side effects**.

* Avoid writing to files/emails from deep inside functions unless that’s their main purpose.
* Return objects or structured output from functions so they can be piped or processed further.
* Test functions individually before integrating them into larger scripts.

## Summary

A few habits go a long way in writing great scripts:

* Use meaningful names
* Keep formatting consistent
* Write helpful comments and add help documentation
* Handle errors gracefully
* Avoid hardcoding values
* Break logic into functions and keep code modular
