# Introduction to PSScriptAnalyzer

## What Is PSScriptAnalyzer?

* A static code analysis tool for PowerShell
* Helps enforce best practices and identify common issues
* Can be used in local development or CI/CD pipelines

### Installing and Importing the Module

* Installation via PowerShell Gallery:

  ```powershell
  Install-Module -Name PSScriptAnalyzer -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

* Verifying installation:

  ```powershell
  Get-Command -Module PSScriptAnalyzer
