    "# Number Guessing Game\n",
    "Do you want to play a game? The computer wants you to guess which number it is thinking of from 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10).\n",
    "\n",
    "The script should:\n",
    "- Generate a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive)\n",
    "- Prompt the user to enter a guess\n",
    "  - **Hint**: Convert the user's input from string to integer\n",
    "    ```[int](Read-Host -Prompt \"`nGuess a number\")```\n",
    "- Tell the user if their guess is higher, lower, or matches the random number\n",
