    "# ```for``` loops\n",
    "The ```for``` loop is used when you know how many times you need to iterate (or loop) through a list or array is known beforehand.\n",
    "The ```for``` statement components are:\n",
    "- **initialization**: sets up a loop control variable (e.g., ```$i = 0```)\n",
    "- **condition**: defines when the loop should continue or stop running (e.g., ```$i -lt 10```)\n",
    "- **iteration**: defines how to update the control variable after each loop completion (e.g, ```$i++```)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax for ```for``` loops is:\n",

    "```powershell\n",
