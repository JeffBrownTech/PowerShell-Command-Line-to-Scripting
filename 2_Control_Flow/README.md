# üîÅ PowerShell Scripting Course  
## Module 2: Control Flow in PowerShell

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, you‚Äôll learn how to control the behavior of your scripts using **conditional logic and loops**. These structures allow your scripts to make decisions, repeat tasks, and respond to different input or conditions dynamically.

---

## üìö What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` to control the script's decision-making
- Repeat tasks with loops like `for`, `foreach`, `while`, and `do-while`
- Use `switch` statements to handle multiple conditions more cleanly
- Identify infinite loops and how to stop them
- Combine control flow with arrays, strings, and numbers for practical tasks

## üìñ Lessons

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 1: Introduction to Conditional Statements](1.if_else_elseif.ipynb)

- Understand how `if`, `elseif`, and `else` blocks work
- Use comparison operators to evaluate conditions
- Learn how short-circuiting works with `-and` and `-or`

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 2: Looping with `for` loops](2.for_loops.ipynb)

- Iterate through arrays and ranges with `for`

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 3: Looping with `foreach` loops](3.foreach_loops.ipynb)

- Process each item in a collection using `foreach`

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 4: Using `while` and `do-while` Loops](4.while_loops.ipynb)

- Write loops that continue based on a condition
- Understand the difference between `while` and `do-while`
- Practice writing loops that stop when input meets a requirement

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 5: Making Decisions with `switch`](5.switch.ipynb)

- Use `switch` for structured and readable conditional logic
- Handle multiple values and patterns
- Use `-Wildcard` and `-Regex` matching for flexible decision logic

### ‚úÖ [Lesson 6: Number Guessing Game Challenge](6.Challenge_Number_Game.ipynb)

- Build an interactive number guessing game
- Apply everything you‚Äôve learned: conditionals, loops, input validation, and more
- Add enhancements like difficulty levels, scoring, and play-again logic
