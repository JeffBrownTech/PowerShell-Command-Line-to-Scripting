    "# ```while``` Loops\n",
    "```while``` loops are useful to continue looping through a code block until a condition is met. There are two variations of ```while``` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ```while``` loop\n",
    "The ```while``` loop continues running the code block as long as condition evaluates to ```true```. PowerShell evaluates the conditions prior to running the loop. This loop's syntax is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "while (<condition>)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    # Loop code goes here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This version of ```while``` loop may never execute if the condition is not met. This example demonstrates a loop that never executes because the condition evaluates to false.\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "$number = 10\n",
    "while ($number -lt 0)\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"This code doesn't run\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is often used to test a loop condition, much like a ```for``` loop. Be sure to modify this variable or you will end up in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the example below and run it to view the ```$counter``` variable increment with each loop until the condition evaluates to ```false```."
