# What are Variables?

Variables in PowerShell serve as placeholders for data, allowing users to store, retrieve, and manipulate information dynamically. They provide flexibility in scripting, enabling automation, user input handling, and data processing.

## Declaring Variables in PowerShell
Unlike some programming languages that require explicit variable declarations, PowerShell allows implicit declarationsâ€”you create a variable by assigning it a value. You denote PowerShell variables using a dollar sign (```$```).

PowerShell Facts and Best Practices:
- Variables names are not case-sensitive.
- Variable names include alphanumeric characters and special characters.
  - However, limit special characters to the underscore character (```_```).
- Variable names can include spaces and specials characters (best practices ask to avoid this).

```powershell
$greeting = "Hello, World!"   # String
$number   = 42                # Integer
$decimal  = 3.14              # Floating-point number
$isReady  = $true             # Boolean (True/False)
```

## PowerShell is Not Strongly Typed
One fundamental difference between PowerShell and many other programming languages (like C# or Java) is that PowerShell is not strongly typed. This means that PowerShell automatically determines the type of a variable based on the assigned value, and it allows variables to change types dynamically.

### Implicit vs. Explicit Typing
By default, PowerShell does not enforce a specific type when assigning values to a variable (**implicit**):

```powershell
$value = 10      # Integer
$value = "Text"  # Now it's a String
```

However, you can enforce a specific type using type casting (**explicit**):
```powershell
[int]$count       = 42
[string]$username = "Admin"
[bool]$isEnabled  = $true
```

### Why Does This Matter?
Since PowerShell allows type changes dynamically, unexpected behavior can occur.
For example, here, "5" is treated as a string, so PowerShell concatenates it with 10 instead of performing addition.

```powershell
$sum = "5" + 10    # Adding a string and integer together
Write-Output $sum  # Outputs: 510 (String concatenation, not addition)
```

You can verify a variable's data type using the ```.GetType()``` method.
```powershell
$count.GetType()
$username.GetType()
$isEnabled.GetType()
```

## Variable Types

- **User-Created**: Created and maintained by the user. Variables you create in the command line only exist while the PowerShell window is open and are deleted when you close the window. You can create a persistent variable by adding it to your PowerShell profile or work with script variables at the global, script, or local scope (more on this in [Section 2. Variable Scope](./2.Variable_Scope.md)).
- **Automatic**: Variables created and maintained by PowerShell automatically. Users cannot change these variable values. Examples include ```$PSHOME```, ```$?```, ```$_```, ```$PROFILE```, and ```$PSEdition```.

- **Preference**: Variables that store user preferences for PowerShell. PowerShell creates these variables and populates them with default values. Users can later change these values as needed. Examples include ```$MaximumHistoryCount``` and ```$ErrorActionPreference```.
- **Environment**: Variables that store information about the operating system and other programs. Environment variables are prefixed with ```$env:```. Examples include ```$env:PSModulePath``` and ```$env:OS```. You can set your own environment variables using this syntax:
    ```powershell
    $Env:<variable-name> = "<new-value>"
    ```
  - **Note**: Environment variable names on macOS and Linux are case-sensitive. For example, ```$env:Path``` and ```$env:PATH``` are different environment variables on non-Windows platforms.
